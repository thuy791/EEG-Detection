# EEG-simulation
MATLAB functions for realistic EEG simulations of background noise and oscillatory signal

Two different functions create simulated background noise and simulated signals of interest

Script example.m contains two examples of use

randraw.m function was obtained from https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7309-randraw

toSpec.m is based on fourierica.m https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/neuroinf/code/fourierica/html/fourierica.html
